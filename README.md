The project that I developed is about a tourism & leisure app, which caters to families and small parties, usually for people between 40 to 60 years of age, interested in tours in Italy escorted by driver guides. As a matter of fact, rates are never displayed. Browsing on the Google Play Store I have not found any kind of apps such as this kind for the Italian market. There are apps which are “guide books” but none of them are run by English speaking driver guides in Italy. This app is intended to give the customer an idea of what type of services Platinum Escapes can provide, bearing in mind that the final tour is always tailored to the specific requirements of the client, which means the tours or excursions listed may change and therefore no rates are shown on the app.
